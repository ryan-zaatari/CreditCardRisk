title: Loan Risk Model
---

## Introduction/Background

For years, banks have placed an immense focus on assessing loan risk. Substantial research has delved into the analysis of loan risks, aiming to uncover correlations and patterns among people who struggle to payback their loans on time. We look to further investigate these patterns and variations in hopes to gain a better understanding of those who face challenges in meeting their financial gains. 

Our research will be based off of the Kaggle dataset: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mishra5001/credit-card?select=application_data.csv).It contains over 300,000 people who have taken out loans and indicates whether they were late to pay installments. The dataset contains 122 columns, or features, those of which include gender, annual income, whether one owns assests such as real estate or a car, credit amount, education, and information on previous loan application/history. 

## Problem Statement

Each year, Banks loan out millions of credit cards to customers. A big issue they face is loaning out cards to customers who either will be late to monthly payemnts or not pay at all and charge off. While it might may seem obvious that banks should avoid lending to customers who are likely to not pay back on time, several factors compel them to continue doing so- diversification, competition, and overall reputation. Our objective is to develop a model that better assesses the risk of incoming customers.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
